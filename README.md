# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
get the values of the first and second coordinates.
## Step 2:
Substitute the values in the distance formula formula
## Step 3:
using the print function, display the distance between the two points.
## Step 4:
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```
x1,y1=[4,2]
x2,y2=[10,6]

d=((((x2-x1)**2)+((y2-y1)**2)))**0.5 
print('{:.2f}'.format(d))

```
### OUTPUT:
